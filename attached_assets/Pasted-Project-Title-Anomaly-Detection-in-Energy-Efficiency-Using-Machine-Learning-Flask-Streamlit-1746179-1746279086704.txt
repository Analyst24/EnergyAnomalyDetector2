Project Title: Anomaly Detection in Energy & Efficiency Using Machine Learning (Flask + Streamlit)
Project Summary: This system is designed to detect anomalies in energy consumption data using machine learning, while delivering a visually appealing and interactive user experience. It will be built with Flask for backend logic and data handling, and Streamlit for front-end dashboard visualization. The system will run completely offline, providing high-quality insights and professional charts.
________________________________________
1. System Structure
1.1 Get Started Page
•	A modern, professional introductory page.
•	Must include dynamic/moving charts or animations related to energy consumption.
•	Minimal text; emphasize visual appeal.
1.2 Login Page
•	Secure login and sign-up with fields: Username, Email, and Password.
•	Background image: energy-related (e.g., power stations, smart grids).
•	No sidebar should be shown on this page.
•	Entire app uses a consistent dark theme.
1.3 Main Interface (After Login)
Navigation via a collapsible side panel with the following sections:
•	Home (professional welcome screen with energy visuals)
•	Dashboard (interactive and visual-heavy)
•	Upload Data (CSV format)
•	Run Detection (select and apply ML models)
•	Results (graphical anomaly insights)
•	Model Insights (performance stats, confusion matrix, evaluate the performance of different anomaly detection models using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics)
•	Recommendations (efficiency tips based on findings)
•	Settings (configuration options)
•	Logout
________________________________________
2. Dashboard and Visualizations
•	Visual-first design with minimal text.
•	Must include:
o	Energy Consumption Overview
o	Anomaly Distribution (red markers or shaded regions)
o	Anomaly Types (bar/pie chart)
o	Time of Day Analysis (bar chart or heatmap)
•	Use Plotly, Seaborn, or other high-quality libraries.
•	Include energy-themed images/icons (e.g., meters, solar panels, grids).
•	All charts must support interactivity.
________________________________________
3. Machine Learning Algorithms
Use the following models:
•	Isolation Forest
•	AutoEncoders
•	K-Means Clustering
Notes:
•	Models must work offline.
•	Built entirely in Python.
•	Optional: Allow user to choose which model to run, or run all for comparison.
________________________________________
4. Data Requirements
4.1 Expected Input CSV Format
•	Must support flexible datasets, but ideally include:
o	timestamp
o	consumption
o	meter_id
o	location
o	temperature
o	humidity
o	season / time_of_day
•	Must handle missing values gracefully (drop, interpolate, or notify user).
•	Include one or more sample datasets for testing.
________________________________________
5. Model Training and Storage
•	Models can either:
o	Retrain every time new data is uploaded (default), OR
o	Store trained models locally for reuse.
•	Developers should structure the backend to support future training storage.
________________________________________
6. Result Export Features
•	Allow users to download:
o	Anomaly reports as CSV or PDF
o	Visualizations as images (PNG/JPEG)
•	Optional: Include auto-generated summary text of findings.
________________________________________
7. Settings and Configurations
•	Under "Settings" section, include:
o	Anomaly detection sensitivity slider (adjust threshold)
o	Theme control (dark only, optional future light mode)
o	Algorithm selection options
________________________________________
8. Error Handling and User Feedback
•	If user uploads incorrect data format:
o	Show friendly, clear error messages
•	On detection complete:
o	Show success message, model used, and key stats
•	Notify if: no anomalies found, file too large, missing data, etc.
________________________________________
9. Performance Requirements
•	System should process large CSV files (up to 100MB) efficiently.
•	Anomaly detection should complete in under 30 seconds for average-size datasets (up to 50k rows).
•	UI transitions and visualizations must load smoothly.
________________________________________
10. Scalability Notes
•	Codebase should support future enhancements:
o	Forecasting modules
o	Predictive alerts
o	Multi-user model profiles
o	Cloud deployment (optional phase 2)

11. Footer
•	Every page must include the footer:

12. Contradiction Handling and Data Conflicts
•	System should flag and log contradictory inputs (e.g., zero energy use in industrial site during peak hours).
•	Streamlit UI must highlight any inconsistencies for user correction.

•	NB 
1.	Focus more on visual interpretation rather than text explanations.
2.	The system should be scalable for future improvements, such as adding forecasting or predictive capabilities.
3.	The system must be 100% offline based
